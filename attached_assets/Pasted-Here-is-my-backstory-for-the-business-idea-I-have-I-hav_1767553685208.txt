Here is my backstory for the business idea I have: I have been a real estate investor for 10+ years.  I have purchased single family homes as well as multi family properties (duplex, quadplex).  On several occasions over the years, I have found myself paying for property inspections on investment deals that after negotiating with the buyer, I have decided not to move forward with.  The inspections usually cost from $300 to $600 USD depending on the size of the property.  After I have walked out of the deal, I'm left with an expensive PDF (inspection report) that is worthless to me.  This has always bothered me, because it is wasted money.  Then, it occurred to me that it would be great to be able to sell it to other people.  Then, some years ago, I had the chance to validate the idea:  I had found myself in the same position of walking out of a deal after performing the inspection.  A couple of days later, I was called by the inspection who performed the inspection who told me that a woman had reached out to him wanting to buy the inspection that was performed on the property for a discounted value.  He (the inspector) told the woman that he was not able to sell it to her because, legally, the document belonged to me, so he gave her my phone number.  She (the investor) called me and explained that she was an investor that was interested in the property and wanted to buy the inspection report from me.  She used this strategy in many deals: buy the inspection report from the previous failed deal at a discounted price and make a cash offer with 0 inspection days if she liked what she saw in the inspection report.  I sold her the report for a symbolic $100 (I just wanted to validate the idea).  

Now, here is the business plan for an app that solves this problem. I want you to take this business plan and create a detailed and thorough plan to build the app.  Read it very carefully so you don’t miss important details.  If you think something should be different feel free to suggest the change, but don’t simply change it because I need to approve it.  It should be written in React (Front End) and Node.js (backend) with a relational database. Authentication should be a basic username + password form, without using the default Replit out of the box auth. 

Ask your product team to do extensive research about the primary user type that would be using this app and include a very detailed description of the UI/UX design for the app that would appeal the most to these type of users. In general, it should be simple, minimalistic and modern. But include any other UI/UX characteristics that should be considered based on your user research.   Also, find the best possible name for the app that would appeal the most to this type of user base.  In general, it should be a modern, short name (startup style)

Here is the business plan and requirements: Strategic MVP Feature Set: (v1.0)
To: Gemini Gem (Technical Head of Product)From: Strategic Business Partner & Co-FounderSubject: Core Feature Requirements & Business Context for MVP
Objective:
We are building a Data-First Marketplace. The primary goal of the MVP is not revenue; it is Data Density. We must minimize the friction of data ingestion (uploading reports) and maximize the utility (immediate value) for the user. Every feature below is designed to drive the "Give-to-Get" behavioral loop.

1. The "Smart" Ingestion Engine (The Data Vacuum)
The Business Context:
Friction Kills Data: Real estate investors are busy. If they have to manually type in "Roof Age" or "HVAC Condition," they will abandon the process.
The Asset: We are not just storing PDFs; we are structuring unstructured data. The value of this company lies in the database of property conditions, not the file storage.
Technical Requirement:
Drag & Drop Interface: Simplest possible UI.
PDF Parsing (OCR/LLM): The system must automatically "read" the uploaded inspection report.
Auto-Extraction: Automatically populate fields for: Property Address, Inspection Date, Major Defects (Safety/Structural), and Summary Findings.
Success Metric: < 30 seconds from "Upload" to "Analysis Ready."
2. The "AI Deal Coach" (The Immediate Hook)
The Business Context:
The "Why Now?": We need users to upload reports during the transaction (before the deal fails).
The Value Prop: We are replacing a "dead PDF" with a "live strategic asset." We give them leverage against the seller.
Technical Requirement:
Generative Output: Upon upload, the system uses an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) to analyze the extracted defects and generate a Negotiation Battlecard.
Output Format: A clean, bulleted list of "Top 3 Negotiation Points" and "Estimated Credit Request" based on the findings.
User Story: "As an investor, I want to upload my report so that I can instantly get a script to ask the seller for a $5,000 price reduction."
3. The "Karma" Credit System (The Virtual Currency)
The Business Context:
Liquidity without Cash: We want to avoid the friction of credit cards in the early days. We are building a barter economy.
Gamification: We need to incentivize "Hoarding" credits. Users should feel motivated to upload old/archive reports just to bank credits for the future.
Technical Requirement:
Ledger System: A simple internal database tracking User_Credits.
Logic:
Action: Upload Report = +X Credits (Credit injection).
Action: Download/View Report = -Y Credits (Credit sink).
Fraud Prevention: Basic hashing to prevent uploading the same PDF twice for double credits.
4. The "Redaction Shield" (The Trust Layer)
The Business Context:
Legal/Privacy Barrier: Users will hesitate to upload if they think their personal info (Name, Phone, Email) will be exposed to strangers.
Liability: We must protect the user from being harassed by future buyers.
Technical Requirement:
Auto-Redaction: The parser must identify and blur/black out PII (Personally Identifiable Information) from the PDF preview and the downloadable file.
Focus Areas: Header/Footer (Client Name), Invoice Page.
5. The "Bounty" Request Engine (Demand Aggregation)
The Business Context:
Solving the Cold Start: New users will search for an address and find nothing. We cannot let them hit a "Dead End." We must convert that "zero results" search into a "demand signal."
Technical Requirement:
"Notify Me" Logic: If Search_Result = Null, display a "Request this Report" CTA.
Bounty Ledger: Allow users to stake Credits on a request.
Notification Trigger: If a report for that address is uploaded later, automatically notify the requester and transfer credits.
